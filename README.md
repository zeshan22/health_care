According to BMI of the person we will assign diet plan according to user requirement from certified nutritionist. In Seasonal diseases user will get information about different diseases. He will get information about the disease like symptoms and how to prevent this. In Live video session, it supports video calls to discuss problems with doctors. There are different doctors available, user will have to pay the fee and user will receive the text that he got appointment. Time of appointment is also written in the text. It will make patients more relaxed as they do not have to stand in a long queue to fix their appointments and book appointments according to their choice in a more convenient way. Doctors need not worry about managing their appointment. Though you are not going to clinic for taking an appointment, your appointment gets book from anywhere and however you want. This helps to save time of patient. Patients can update their problem to doctors by messaging and get advice from the doctor. Through the messaging services patients can seek 24/7 help from doctors.
